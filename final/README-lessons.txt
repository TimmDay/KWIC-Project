Lessons Learned

- Object Oriented programming techniques.
we tried to get fancy with the hash maps, but in practice, having everything in one class proved messy. Making edits was difficult, as they affected a wide range of things instead of being contained. Using sentence or word objects would also have made printing to XML easier.
That all said, our technique did work and return nice results

- Testing. We mainly used User Testing, and Procedural testing using print methods to the console. Again, using better OO principles we could have made this a lot easier

- Version Control.
we would have saved

- Variable naming and comments.
Especially when working in a team, it is important to be on top of this, It can be difficult to follow each others code otherwise
